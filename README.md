# UBC-Rez
An entirely original database application that maps out the UBC housing system and allows those learning SQL to try out different types of queries and view their real-time updates - can be viewed at https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~ashaaban/milestone3.php

Note: Unfortunately since graduating from UBC, we no longer have access to their Oracle servers and can't manipulate data.
